                I'm interested in many aspects of Computer Science such as: backend web development, cryptography, blockchain and capture the flag tournaments (even though I do not participate in them). 
                One of my greatest hobby is taking part in hackathons. I won my very first hackathon called **Let's Hack !T** (organised by Credit Suisse) and am really proud of it. Being a part of the team in such event allowed me to learn new things very fast, for example I learned a bit of <mark>Python</mark> with <mark>Flask</mark> framework writing a [simple app](https://github.com/asi-pwr/geolottery) on last HackYeah in Warsaw. My uni lecturers taught me technologies like: <mark>OCaml</mark>, <mark>Scala</mark> or <mark>C++</mark>. One of my dreams is to become a professional speaker on IT conferences.
                Programming is my passion but sitting in front of the screen can be exhausting so in my free time I enjoy playing volleyball, cycling or swimming. On holiday I choose mountain wandering (the Izera Mountains are my favourite).
